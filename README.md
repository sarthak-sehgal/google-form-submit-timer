# Auto Submit Google Form Timer

Auto Submit Google Form Timer is a Chrome Extension that allows you to set a timer and auto-submit a Google Form when the timer ends. You can disable the option to auto-submit the form. **Note that the auto-submit feature only works when there is a submit button on the page (that is, there is no "Next" button).**
